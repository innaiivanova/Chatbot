# Codecademy based definitions and tasks when creating a chatbot
# Inna I. Ivanova

Definitions:
- An utternace is a user statement that the chatbot attempts to match to an intent.
- An intent is the purpose or the category of the user query, such as to retrieve a list of hotels.
- An entity is a value, like a user name or account number, that is parsed from a user utternace and passed into a function associated with the matched intent.

Tasks:
1. Greet the user
2. Handle the conversation
3. Match the user's response (utternace)
4. Handle different intents
5. Handle responces that don't match intent
6. Extending the chatbot
